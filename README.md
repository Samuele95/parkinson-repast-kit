## Overview
PRKModel is a MultiAgent-Based Model (MABM) designed to simulate Parkinson's disease using Repast Simphony. It models the interactions within the nervous system, including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, cytokines, and mitochondria, to study the progression of Parkinson's disease. The framework supports the collection of statistical data on the states and activities of these agents.

## Docs
Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Samuele95/parkinson-repast-kit/wiki) for the overall docs and usage instructions.

## Key Features
- **Agent-Based Design:** Autonomous agents representing neurons, astrocytes, microglia, mitochondria, and cytokines.
- **Simulation Environment:** Built using Repast Simphony for agent-based modeling and 3D visualization.
- **Data Collection:** Integrated data collection for statistics on agent states and interactions.
- **Biological Fidelity:** Models key biological processes such as dopamine production, mitochondrial transfer, and inflammatory responses.

## Installation

1. **Download the installer:**
   Download the installer package from the [releases](https://github.com/Samuele95/parkinson-repast-kit/releases) section.

2. **Run the installer:**
   Follow the instructions provided by the installer. Ensure that you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

## Usage

1. **Set up the simulation:**
   Configure the parameters using the provided configuration file or via the Repast Simphony GUI.

2. **Run the simulation:**
   Launch the simulation using the Repast Simphony runtime environment. The prebuilt packages include all necessary dependencies.

3. **Collect data:**
   Use the `DataCollector` class to gather statistics during the simulation.
